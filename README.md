Fork of: https://gitlab.com/nilenso/dotemacs

## Installing

### Get Emacs

#### OS X

Install vanilla Emacs as a Mac app from http://emacsformacosx.com. Other options, like Aquamacs, are supposed to make Emacs more “Mac-like,” but they’re problematic in the long run because they’re set up so differently from standard Emacs that it’s difficult to use the Emacs manual or follow along with tutorials.

#### Ubuntu
Follow the instructions at https://launchpad.net/~cassou/+archive/emacs.

#### Windows
You can find a binary at http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/. After you download and unzip the latest version, you can run the Emacs executable under bin\runemacs.exe.

### Setup Configuration
```
git clone https://github.com/ukriish/dotemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Open emacs and you're good to go. Happy Hacking!
